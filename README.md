## 🌍 Our Mission: Beyond Fashion, Towards Impact

Fashion is one of the **most polluting industries** on Earth:
- 🚰 It takes **2,700 liters of water** to make one cotton t-shirt  
- 🏭 **10% of global carbon emissions** come from fashion  
- 🗑️ Over **92 million tons of textile waste** are created annually  

But here's what excites us: **Every single swap helps reverse that impact.**

When you trade on ReWear, you're not just getting new clothes — you're participating in a **circular economy** that values reuse over waste.

## 🌱 Why ReWear?

Fashion is identity, expression, culture — but it's also one of the **most wasteful** industries.

Millions of wearable clothes end up in landfills. We asked:

> **What if clothing didn’t have to be disposable?**  
> **What if it could be celebrated, reimagined — again and again?**

**ReWear** is the answer.  
A platform to **swap clothes**, discover hidden gems, and express style — all while helping the planet.

**ReWear** is a **community-powered fashion exchange platform** that makes sustainable fashion:

- **Fun**
- **Rewarding**
